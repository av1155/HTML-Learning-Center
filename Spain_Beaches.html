    <h2 class="main2">Introduction</h2>
    <p class="indentation">
      Before I start talking about beaches, I should probably introduce myself.
      My name is <b>Andrea</b> and I am originally from <u>Spain</u>. In Spain,
      there are countless beaches, ranging from <i>Las Islas Canarias</i> all
      the way to <i>Barcelona</i>. My favorite beach is the one in Marbella,
      because this is where I'm from; I have countless memories there!

    <h2 class="main2">Commands</h2>

    <p>
      There are many more commands for styling text, these are: <br />
      <b>Bold "b"</b>
      <br />
      <i>Italics "i"</i>
      <br />
      <u>Underline "u"</u>
      <br />
      <big>Big Text "big"</big>
      <br />
      <span style="font-size: larger">
        Big text "through CSS by writing span, then style, then font-size, then
        larger."
      </span>
      <!-- It is considered wrong to use BIG now. Instead, use CSS like shown above. Big is obsolete. -->
      <br />
      <small>Small Text "small" </small>
      <br />
      <strong
        >This is used to bold and make it important for the user
        "strong"</strong
      >
      <br />
      <em>This is used to italic and make it important for the user "em" </em>
      <br />
      <sup> Supscript = Higher baseline for typographical reasons "sup" </sup>
      <br />
      <sub> Subscript = Lower baseline for typographical reasons "sub" </sub>
      <br />
      <ins>Text that has been inserted (update) to a document "ins" </ins>
      <br />
      <del>Text that has been deleted (update) from a document "del"</del>
    </p>
    <p>
      Another command is the use of ordered lists "ol" and unordered lists "ul."
      <br />
      The actual list attribute is "li." <br> An example of a numbered list would be: 
      <br> 
      <ol>
        <li>Number 1</li>
        <li>Number 2</li>
        <li>Number 3</li>
        <li>Number 4</li>
      </ol>
      An example of an unordered list would be: 
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Number 1</li>
        <li>Number 2</li>
        <li>Number 3</li>
        <li>Number 4</li>
      </ul>

<!-- To start a form, first use attribute "form", then use attribute "label"
    for setting a description, then use attribute "input" to select what type
    of form is being used, for example, password value makes it so when you type
    it looks like a password. There are other types of input, such as "radio" for
    choices, and "checkbox" for multiple selection. You can also use attribute
    "submit" to make a button. To make the button redirect you somewhere, the
    attribute form has to be followed by an action. Inside the action you place a URL,
    and then select either "get" or "post". Input tag has no end tag, that is why the 
    text goes at the end. -->

    <!-- The section above is for learning, it contains all the attributes 
      for styling, ordering text, and setting up tables in HTML-->

    <!-- 
      To start a table use attribute "table", to start a row use "tr", to
      write main bold category use "th", to write rest of table use "td". 
      Colspan is for filling the table with blank horizontally (expanding a cell),
     and rowspan is for filling the table with blank vertically (expanding a row)

    <p id="marbella" class="city1">
      Marbella, <br />
      Spain

    <p class="indentation">
      I am originally from this beautiful city, and my family used to go to this
      beach all the time. The mountain that you can see off to the distance is
      called La Concha, and we also spent lots of hours there, it is a beautiful
      spot that I recommend to anyone. The port that is in the top right of the
      picture is called Puerto BÃ¡nus, this is a hotspot for activities such as
      dining or walking.

      This beach in Punta del Este is a beautiful spot with a cool sculpture of
      a huge buried hand. I used to live here as well! Uruguay is quite windy so
      the beaches here are mainly used for surfing.

      This beach is located in the West of Costa Rica and it is one of the best
      beaches in the country. There are many things to do here; however,
      exploring the tropical area is the main attraction.
